<p>Overall feels pretty similar to games like Perverted Education. Which is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there's a few things that prevent me from enjoying the sub-content much:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's too many niche fetishes that I'd have to enjoy in order to enjoy the game. Incest doesn't do much for me (especially when almost all the NPCs are just abusive assholes), I can't stand the whole BNWO bullshit (black dicks are fine, but the whole "you're a sissy so you must be into BBC" thing is just racist and stupid). Yes, there are content toggles, but the non-toggleable content is often still very kink-specific.</li>
<li>Many of the events/scenes don't make much sense when repeated. For me this resulted in a lot of tedious skipping. Maybe it would help to make variations of them that are a bit shorter and written in a way that makes them more fitting as repeating events/scenes.</li>
<li>The pacing of the different aspects of feminization/sissification feels a bit off sometimes. E.g. chastity is introduced rather late instead of using it as leverage to force MC into accepting other stuff. Not necessarily a bad thing, but to me the overall transformation felt a bit odd due to this.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of this is just personal taste, so maybe it's just not the right game for me to enjoy :)</p>

<p>v0.16 review</p>
<p>The game has decent visuals, but there's one thing I don't understand. For the life of me, I can't understand why the author has bothered to have separate characteristics for the masculine/feminine and dominant/submissive axes. There's no apparent way in the game to be simultaneously dominant and feminine or submissive and masculine.</p>
<p>A major flaw I perceive in the current version of the game is the BBC content that's part of the submissive path. It strikes me as needlessly stereotypical and not something I'd expect as part of a game allegedly set in Budapest. If a game is set in a particular real place, I expect the demographics of the game to match the setting.</p>
<p>The ashtray content was a definite minus for me. Not only do I find smoking utterly unsexy, but having my character be an ashtray just doesn't fit what I want out of a game. The dom path remains somewhat interesting but not enough for me to follow it on every release cycle.</p>
<p>It's nice that the author has added ways to block certain kinks. However, it's fairly clear that the author is both focusing upon the sub path and has a different version of subbiness than I do. I'll probably give it another go once more dom content is added, but for now, I only updated my review because the author addressed my desire that kinks be selectable.</p>

<p>Played v0.16. I vaguely recall playing this a long time ago. This now feels like a near complete game, and calling it 'only' v0.16 (or 18 for the patreon version) is an undersell. Great game.</p>

<p>This game lacks any sort of nuance or feeling. MC is a pushover that somehow manages to get several women to own him.</p>

<p>Very good game, but lacks content. It does not mean that there is no content, but there are various paths so content gets saturated. For example if patreon users vote on sub content you will not get dom one for some time. And honestly, both paths are fine but Sub path is more sexy. Still a game which can be enjoyed in either of paths. Complete version of this one will be something very close to legendary HTML games like Company and Secretary.</p>
<p>Edit: I was wrong here. It may not be very close, but somewhere far. This game focuses too much on events, while more events are always good things, here it creates an issue, lack of customization. There is only 1 dress to purchase and use. There are no feminine shoes you can buy, hairstyles are locked in, basically while transformation is there, you have very limited control over the character itself once you pick up either of the two core path. Customaization is very essential aspect, I thought that other feminine products will be there when you become a complete sissy, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>And also, Dev please work on Optional Homosexual Boyfriend. I don't like Remy at all. It is one thing wanting a cuck but she sees MC as a wallet, I can get no respect but she has no love too. She is so pathetic that even black men refused to breed her when she begged for it claiming that they want to be away from this psycho. Make that guy not only a side person but someone of a master for sissy MC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
